# Koorta dancing spider game

This game was developed in 2023 as part of a group game jam, hosted by <a href="https://levelherup.com.au/">Level Her Up</a>.

The project brief was to create a game about connection. Our team agreed on the concept of connection to country and land, from there we settled on the idea of a dancing spider game based on the Perth local the peacock spider.

Players need to match their keyboard input (or footwork with the appropriate connection) with the instructions on the screen to make the peacock spider dance.
